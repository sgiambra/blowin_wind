\begin_layout Abstract
\noindent
This paper estimates the impact of wind turbines presence at the ZIP code
 and census tract level on house prices.
 A na√Øve OLS specification shows no evidence of a relation between wind
 turbines and house prices.
 Using an instrumental variables strategy where the instrument is defined
 as the percentage of the area of the ZIP code or census tract with potential
 wind capacity in 2008 greater than 30%, interacted with a dummy set to
 one in the years after the first wind turbine was installed in the US,
 I find that the presence of a wind farm significantly reduces house prices.
 An event-study design brings additional evidence of this relation.

The world energy demand has grown exponentially over the last decades.
 In 2015 the overall energy consumption was about 575 quadrillion British
 thermal units (Btu) and the most recent projections from the 2017 International
 Energy Outlook forecast a new pick of 736 quadrillion Btu in 2040

 shows that world energy use rose by 56.9% from 1990 through 2015.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For a direct comparison with the previously reported fact, one million Btu
 is roughly equivalent to 25.1996 tonne of oil equivalent (toe).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In this framework, wind energy represents a key option for a sustainable
 future for two main reasons.
 First, wind is a clean and renewable energy source that produces virtually
 no toxic pollution or global warming emissions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "energygov"

\end_inset

.
 Second, wind power production has very low operating and maintenance costs
 compared to traditional sources of energy, with nearly all the cost being
 related to wind turbines' construction and installation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cullen2013measuring"

\end_inset

.
 In accordance with this view, the US wind energy sector has been characterized
 by a fast expansion during the last fifteen years, growing from a cumulative
 power capacity of less than 2,500 MW in 1999 to about 85,000 MW at the
 end of 2017 (see panel B of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the public opinion is typically in favor of wind power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "firestone2007public"

\end_inset

, the construction of wind farms has often to overcome the opposition of
 local communities.
 A major concern is that the visual and aural impact of wind farms might
 decrease house values in the surrounding areas.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another concern is that the noise and vibrations generated by wind farms
 could directly harm individuals living close to the plant.
 Although the traditional medical literature finds no evidence of a negative
 relationship between wind turbines and health 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, a recent study claims that psychological factors might play a role in

The object of this paper is to analyze the impact of wind turbines presence
 on house prices.
 Using data on the location and building date of each turbine from the Federal
 Aviation Administration (FAA), and home prices from Zillow and the Federal
 Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), I am able to estimate changes in house prices
 for areas that are or are not allocated a wind farm.
 However, the presence of wind turbines in a given geographic area is clearly
 an endogenous outcome since infrastructure projects are usually targeted
 towards areas in specific economic conditions

 or influenced by political variables.
 I thus rely on two empirical strategies to try to isolate the causal impact
 of wind turbines on house prices.
 First, I instrument for wind turbines presence using the percentage of
 the area of the ZIP code or census tract with potential wind capacity in
 2008 greater than 30%, interacted with a dummy set to one in the years
 after the first wind turbine was installed in the US.
 Gross potential wind capacity factors are estimated for the US by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lopez2012us"

\end_inset

 taking into account the technology available in 2008 and local wind resources.
 The 30% threshold is often used by engineers to determine the profitability
 of a site 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "LectureA"

\end_inset

.
 The hypothesis underlying this instrument is that locations having a larger
 area above the threshold are more likely to be allocated a wind farm.
 Second, I perform an event study analysis to investigate how house prices
 change in the years before and after a wind farm is constructed.
 The event is defined as the time in which an aggregate of at least ten
 wind turbines becomes operative in a certain location.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from my preferred instrumental variable specification show that
 each additional wind turbine installed in a given year decreases home prices
 by about 0.3%.
 This is a remarkable negative effect considering that, on average, there
 are 17 new turbines installed in a ZIP code/year, conditional on non-zero
 construction.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The standard deviation is about 27 new turbines in the average ZIP code/year.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 On the other hand, the results of the event study are more noisy due to
 the intrinsic difficulty to identify an exact point in time in which the
 wind plant starts exerting a negative impact on house prices.
 Consequently, this approach appears to be less informative about the causal
 impact of wind turbines on home prices.

ns within a mile of a wind farm in Cornwall, UK.
 The authors do not find any significant evidence of a causal effect of
 wind turbines on house prices, but this conclusion might be driven by the
 limitations of the data used.
 More recently,

 Both of the aforementioned articles, however, are unable to uncover significant
 evidence of the impact of wind turbines on house prices.
 Focusing on Rhode Island, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 use data from 3,254 transactions of houses within a mile of a wind turbine,
 finding no significant effect.
 A fair amount of other studies employing DD techniques have instead reached
 conclusions in favor of the hypothesis of a negative impact on house value.

 develop a slightly more articulated digital elevation model to create a
 200m grid that shows if a turbine is visible or not from each location.
 The author uses then a DD comparing price changes in locations where a
 new turbine is built and is visible with different comparison groups, such
 as price changes in places where the new turbine is hidden by the terrain
 or became visible in the past.
 The main conclusion of the study is that visible wind turbines decrease
 house prices by 5-6% within 2km, and by less than 1% within 14km.

In this paper, I contribute to this literature in two different ways.
 First, I enlarge the scope of the analysis using data on wind turbines
 in each state of the US through the end of 2017.
 Second, in the preferred specification, I address the endogeneity issue
 of the allocation of a wind turbine to a given geographic area using an
 instrumental variable approach similar to the one exploited by

\begin_layout Standard
To analyze how the presence of wind turbines affects house values, I construct
 a panel that covers the period from 2000 to 2016, where variables are aggregate
d at the zip code level.
 Median home selling prices per square foot are collected from Zillow.

 All types of homes are considered, that is, all single-family, condominium
 and co-operative homes with a county record.
 Zillow provides other measures of home values, as for instance the Zillow
 Home Value Index (ZHVI) that measures the median seasonally adjusted home
 value for a given area.
 However, these metrics are the output of statistical models that take already
 into account characteristics such as local amenities and are thus less
 indicated for the current analysis.
 To the house prices panel I add data on wind turbines made available by
 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which contains monthly data
 through September 2016 on the exact position of each wind turbine in the
 US.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 displays the time trend for median home selling prices in the US
 as it emerges from Zillow data.
 The dashed line shows the trend obtained averaging across all zip codes
 that are allocated a wind turbine during the period for which house price
 data is available or before.
 The solid line reports the corresponding trend for zip codes that do not
 receive a wind turbine in the period considered or before it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prices trend similarly over time in zip codes with and without a wind turbine,
 although they are somewhat noisy, reflecting the existence of a seasonal
 component.
 The empirical distribution of median home selling prices for the zip codes
 covered in the Zillow data is instead shown in Figure 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distribution is computed after excluding some observations from the
 dataset according to the following procedure.
 I first identify 183 zip code-month units that are associated with a median
 house price higher than $1000.
 If all other observations for the same zip code in different months have
 home prices below this cutoff, I treat the flagged value as a typo and
 I drop it from the dataset while leaving the other months.
 If instead there is more than one case of prices above the cutoff within
 the same zip code, I also drop all other observations related to that zip
 code.
 In total, I end up eliminating 21,567 zip code-month observations, or slightly
 more than 2.2% of the original dataset.
 As expected, the distribution of median home selling prices is highly right
 skewed.
 The mean value taken by this variable is about $150.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the Zillow median home selling prices I add then geographic and census
 data.
 Annual average wind raster data with a resolution from 200-meter to 1000-meter
 cell sizes is made available by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
 (NREL).

 For instance, appendix figure 1 shows the map assembled by NREL detailing
 wind level in Rhode Island.
 Wind speeds are recorded at a 50-meter height above the ground.
 Wind power is then grouped into classes that range from poor (class 1)
 to superb (class 7).
 High resolution land-based wind data for Alabama, Florida, Louisiana or
 Mississippi is unfortunately not available; these states will thus be excluded
 from the analysis.
 Other geographic characteristics that are used as control variables are
 the distance from the coastline, elevation, and urbanized areas in year
 2000.

 In order to aggregate these variables at the zip code level, I first merge
 the related files in ArcGIS with the map detailing zip code boundaries.
 I then compute the percentage of the area of a given zip code that is recorded
 as urban according to the 2000 Census.
 Concerning the two other geographic controls, I instead find the centroid
 of each zip code and calculate the distance from the coastline and elevation
 related to these points.

 These variables are collected at the census block group level, and I have
 thus to map them into the zip code polygons at which house prices are aggregate
d.
 To do this, I match each zip code with the block group that occupies the
 largest fraction of its area.
 This is certainly an imperfect mapping between zip codes and block groups,
 since it could happen that the same block group is matched to multiple
 zip codes.
 At the moment I am still working on the development of an algorithm that
 performs this operation in a more precise way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sample characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data related to wind turbine locations and other geographic and demographic
 variables is basically available for the entire US.
 On the other hand, I have information on median home selling prices only
 on a subsample of the full set of US zip codes.
 Appendix figure 2 makes this point more explicit.
 It shows in blue the zip codes for which information on home prices is
 available from Zillow.
 The red triangles represent wind turbines within these zip codes.
 Obviously, the zip codes included in the sample are not randomly selected
 and they likely correspond to highly populated geographic areas.
 However, at least for some of the US states, they represent a large fraction
 of the complete set of zip codes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering only zip codes for which I have house prices, table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:cov_balance"

\end_inset

 presents a summary of means and standard deviations of the key variables
 used in the analysis that follows.
 Column 1 displays descriptive statistics for the full sample, while column
 2 and 3 distinguish between zip codes characterized by the presence of
 a wind turbine or not.
 Areas with wind turbines are on average more distant from the coastline,
 have a higher elevation, and are less populated.
 They have a lower income per capita, a higher fraction of white inhabitants,
 and a lower fraction of blacks and asians.
 Moreover, they tend to have a higher fraction of male residents and of
 individuals with lower education (high school degree or less).
 The last row shows that the zip codes that are not allocated a wind turbine
 are characterized by a lower fraction of the total geographic area having
 annual average wind with power class greater or equal than three.
 The correlation between average wind and wind turbines location can be
 visually inspected from Figure 4 (as well as appendix figure 3).
 The figure makes it evident that wind turbines (depicted as black triangles)
 tend to be placed in areas characterized by higher wind level (dark-shaded).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column 4 of Table 1 shows that zip codes with and without a wind turbine
 are significantly different in terms of the variables considered.
 Since this paper uses the percentage of the area of a zip code having average
 wind of category three or more as instrument, I can investigate if the
 covariates are balanced conditional on this variable.
 Column 5 shows the coefficients estimated regressing each exogenous control
 on the percentage of zip code area having wind of power class larger than
 three, while column 6 adds to the regression all the other covariates as
 controls, together with state fixed effects.
 The differences in total population, percentage of black and asian population
 and level of education tend to disappear.
 The coefficients for the distance from the coastline, elevation and percentage
 of white and male population remain significant but considerably small.
 Income per capita is the only variable that remains statistically significant
 and with a large coefficient after regressing it on the wind variable and
 controlling for the other zip code characteristics.
 Overall however, the instrument seems to achieve a good balance of the
 covariates considered in the analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
If the presence of a wind turbine in a given zip code was determined randomly,
 I could in principle be able to estimate its effect on house values using
 the following model
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln\left(p_{lt}\right)=\alpha_{l}+\beta turbines_{lt}+\mathbf{X}_{lt}\boldsymbol{\theta}+\tau_{t}+\varepsilon_{lt}\label{eq:ols}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\left(p_{lt}\right)$
\end_inset

 measures the average house value in location 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 (zip code or census tract), and time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (year or month), while 
\begin_inset Formula $turbines_{lt}$
\end_inset

 describes the number of wind turbines active in that location.
 The other parameters in the model ‚Äì 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}$
\end_inset

 ‚Äì capture fixed effects for location and time, respectively.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{lt}$
\end_inset

 represents a vector of time varying location characteristics, such as average
 household income, total population, high education rate, and minority prevalenc
e.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are willing to assume that the vector of location specific control
 variables remains constant over the time period relevant for this analysis
 ‚Äì i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{lt}=\mathbf{X}_{l}$
\end_inset

 ‚Äì we can rewrite equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ols"

\end_inset

 in first differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta ln\left(p_{lt}\right)=\beta\Delta turbines_{lt}+\tau_{t}+\Delta\varepsilon_{lt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the coefficients estimated running simple OLS on equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ols"

\end_inset

 are likely to be biased by the existence of omitted variables that are
 correlated with both the change in house values and wind turbine presence.
 For instance, if poorer geographic areas are more likely to be allocated
 a wind turbine, and the price of houses in these areas is lower, then this
 would generate a negative relationship between turbines and house prices.
 In the attempt to reduce this problem, I control for a vector of zip code
 level covariates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{zs0}$
\end_inset

, measured in 2000, the baseline period of the analysis.
 Among the control variables I include distance from the coastline; elevation;
 percentage of urbanized area; total population; fraction of whites, blacks
 and asians; income per capita; and educational attainment.
 Unfortunately, even after controlling for these zip code characteristics
 it is still likely that the estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be biased due to omitted or unobservable variables and confounding
 trends.
 To identify the causal impact of wind turbines on house values I therefore
 rely on an instrumental variable approach.
 I use annual average 50-meter height above the ground wind data to construct
 a variable that measures the percentage of the area of a given zip code
 having wind of power category equal or higher than three.
 Since the productivity of wind turbines depends, among other geographic
 characteristics, on the location's wind power, this instrument is likely
 to be a good predictor for wind turbine presence.
 The two equations related to the IV approach are the following
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \text{First stage:}\quad\Delta turbines_{lt}=\pi Z_{lt}+\tau_{t}+\nu_{lt}\label{eq:first_stage}\\
 &  & \text{Second stage:}\quad\Delta ln\left(p_{lt}\right)=\beta\Delta\widehat{turbines_{lt}}+\tau_{t}+\Delta\varepsilon_{lt}\label{eq:second_stage}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

I will now discuss more in details why the instrument I construct is based
 on the cutoff of a power class equal to three.
 As mentioned above, wind data is reported by the NREL on the basis of seven
 wind power classes.
 In order to construct an instrumental variable that is relevant to the
 allocation decision of a wind turbine to a given location, I rely on the
 fact that, as noted in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Areas designated class 3 or greater are suitable for most wind turbine applicati
ons, whereas class 2 areas are marginal.
 Class 1 areas are generally not suitable, although a few locations (e.g.,
 exposed hilltops not shown on the maps) with adequate wind resource for
 wind turbine applications may exist in some class 1 areas.

 Therefore, I choose to compute the percentage of the geographic area of
 each zip code that is characterized by average wind level of at least class
 three.

Practically, this step is implemented in ArcGIS intersecting the map containing
 wind level information with that reporting the US zip code boundaries.

 The results of the analysis that follows remain mainly unchanged if I choose
 slightly different specifications of the instrument, as for instance adding
 also areas with average wind of power class two.

\begin_layout Subsection
Threats to IV validity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now present the main results of the IV approach outlined in the previous
 section.
 Table 2 reports the estimates obtained in the first stage.
 In all specifications standard errors are clustered at the date specific
 (
\begin_inset Formula $year\times month$
\end_inset

) level.
 The dependent variable is an indicator that is equal to one whenever a
 wind turbine is present in a certain zip code and month.
 In column (1), the first row indicates that for a 10% increase in the area
 of the zip code having wind of at least category three, the probability
 of receiving a wind turbine increases by more than half percentage points.
 Column (2) adds to this baseline model the vector of control variables
 listed before.
 The size of the coefficient remains basically unchanged, as well as the
 F-statistic which is highly above the rule-of-thumb threshold of 10.
 Moving to column (3), I include state and date specific fixed effects.
 In this case, the coefficient of the first row shows that a 10% increase
 in the area of a zip code with average wind level of power class of at
 least three increases by 0.6% the probability that a wind turbine will be
 assigned to that zip code.
 The coefficients of the covariates included in column (2) and (3) have
 generally the expected signs: for instance, zip codes characterized by
 high elevation have on average a higher probability to be allocated a wind
 turbine.
 On the other hand, wind turbines are less frequently found in richer and
 more populated areas.
 A somehow less intuitive result comes from the negative coefficient of
 the variable measuring the percentage of the area of the zip code being
 urbanized in year 2000.
 We would in fact expect that wind turbines are more frequently allocated
 to highly rural zip codes.
 A possible explanation to reconcile this finding is that wind turbines
 are not directly placed in urban areas but next to them, in order to represent
 an alternative source of energy in locations where energy demand is particularl
y high.
 Moreover, this could also be a mechanic consequence of the fact that the
 zip codes for which Zillow collects data on home selling prices are not
 a random selection of the universe of US zip codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 5 is a graphic representation of the first stage just discussed.
 I first regress the instrument on the vector of covariates together with
 state fixed effects.
 Next, I take the residuals obtained from this regression and plot them
 against the indicator for turbine presence in the zip code.
 As a last step I fit a local quadratic regression on this data using the
 rule-of-thumb bandwidth suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "fan1996local"

\end_inset

.
 Consistent with the earlier estimates the probability to find a turbine
 in a given zip code is increasing in the residualized percentage area of
 the zip code with average wind of category three or higher.
 Consistently with the monotonicity assumption, also the slope is increasing
 in the residualized instrumental variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We turn next to the analysis of the results from the OLS regression of median
 home selling price per square foot on turbine presence, reported in the
 first three columns of Table 3.
 Standard errors are clustered at the date specific level in all specifications.
 The coefficients related to the complete model -- shown in column (3) --
 suggest that the presence of a turbine in a given zip code decreases the
 house prices by $20, everything else kept constant.
 As intuitively expected, distance from the coastline and elevation have
 also a negative and significant effect on home selling prices, while an
 opposite relation exists for instance in the case of income per capita.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the OLS coefficient on wind turbine presence shows already some
 evidence of a negative effect on house prices, this relationship could
 be biased by the presence of omitted variables and endogeneity in the choice
 of the area where wind turbines are built.
 To be able to isolate an exogenous source of variation in wind turbines
 allocation to zip codes I instrument wind turbine presence with annual
 average wind level as discussed in the previous section.
 The coefficients estimated using the IV approach are reported in column
 (4) to (6).
 Once again, standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the date specific
 level.
 In all three columns we confirm the hypothesis that wind turbine presence
 has a negative and statistically significant effect on home values.
 Focusing on column (6), where I include all controls together with state
 and date fixed effects, the negative impact on house prices is found to
 be as large as $122.
 It is important to notice that the 2SLS coefficients of wind turbine presence
 are way larger than the correspondent OLS estimates.
 This is likely due to the presence of measurement error in the price variable
 that is not completely eliminated by simply dropping outlier observations
 as discussed before.

\begin_layout Section
Event study analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative approach to the instrumental variable estimation, I perform
 an event study of the effect of wind turbines on house values.
 In their study of displaced workers' earnings losses, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "jacobson1993earnings"

\end_inset

 develop a framework to analyze multiple events occurring at different timings.
 I adopt the notation presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sandler2012multiple"

\end_inset

, who offer an overview of the recent literature of multiple event studies.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{zst}$
\end_inset

 denote the value of houses in zip code 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, state 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and time
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and call 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{z}$
\end_inset

 the date of the event occurring in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Then, I can estimate the following model
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{zst}=\sum_{d=-D,d\neq-1}^{D}1(t-e^{z}=d)\beta_{d}+\alpha_{t}+\gamma_{s}+\epsilon_{zst}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{t}$
\end_inset

 denote time fixed effects and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{s}$
\end_inset

 capture state fixed effects.

Figure 6 displays the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{d}$
\end_inset

 of the equation above for the median home selling prices per square foot
 collected by Zillow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time window considered is 3 years before and after a turbine is erected
 in a given zip code.
 Observations in the plot are the coefficients estimated from the sample
 of zip codes where wind turbines are actually built.
 This implicit restriction imposed by the event study framework limits the
 power of this analysis since the dataset I use contains only 269 cases
 of zip codes where a wind turbine is located and information on house prices
 is available.
 Moreover, requiring to observe at least three years before and after the
 turbine is built limits this sample set even further.
 The consequence of these restrictions is that no clear pattern emerges
 from the event study plot shown in Figure 6.
 More precisely, the figure shows that home selling prices decrease on average
 the year before a wind turbine is built, but this drop is not different
 in magnitude than the one measured two years after the event making the
 interpretation of any of those pattern less credible.
 Moreover, the standard errors related to the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{d}$
\end_inset

 (not depicted in the figure) are extremely large and eliminate any statistical
 difference between the observations plotted.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions and future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper investigates the relation between wind turbine presence at the
 zip code level and home values.
 It uses the percentage of the area of a given zip code having annual average
 wind level of category three or more to address problems related to the
 endogenous placement of wind turbines and other confounding trends.
 Results from the 2SLS estimation suggest that home selling prices in places
 that are allocated a wind turbine are on average $120 lower.
 On the other hand, the event study analysis does not convincingly show
 any particular trend before and after a wind turbine is constructed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the findings discussed in this paper clearly point towards the direction
 of an existing negative relation between wind turbines presence and home
 values, this evidence if far from being conclusive.
 However, Zillow will soon release a new version of its public available
 house price dataset that will cover the entire US at the census tract level.
 This will help reducing the issue of sample selection faced by this study
 and likely add more robustness to its results.
